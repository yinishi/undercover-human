# Undercover Human

## Rules:

Players are randomly matched with a chat partner and must guess whether they are a human or a chat bot. After making the guess, the player is paired with a new partner, Chat Roulette-style.

## Scoring System:

- 1 point for a correct guess
- 5 points if you can fool your partner into thinking you are a bot
- -3 points for an incorrect guess

As you can see from the scoring system, players are highly incentivized to behave as much like a chat bot as possible.
